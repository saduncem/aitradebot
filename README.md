# LLM Supported Crypto Trading Automation System

This project is a prototype trading bot that combines rule-based strategies with LLM-driven advisory components. It consists of several layers:

- **Data Layer**: WebSocket feed, database models, and vector database helper.
- **Decision Engine**: Rule engine and LLM advisor for dynamic suggestions.
- **Trading Layer**: Paper trading simulator and placeholder for live trading.
- **Monitoring**: FastAPI server serving a basic Chart.js dashboard.
- **Scheduler**: Stream runner and news fetcher stubs.

The system is designed for experimentation with scalping strategies using a starting capital of 100 USD and aims to increase coin holdings while protecting capital.
